This GAN is made for Image-to-Image translations, meaning one image to be mapped with another image. For example , 

    If summer and winter are made to undergo the process of Image-Image translation we find a mapping function that could convert summer images into that of winter images and vice versa by adding or removing features according to the mapping function,such that the predicted output and actual output have minimized loss.
